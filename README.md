# TUTORIAL: Develop a virtual assistant for health to predict heart failure using neural network on Modeller Flow in Cloud Pack for Data (Watson Studio), via Watson Machine Learning, connected to Watson Assistant thru an action on Cloud Functions

> **DISCLAIMER**: This application is used for demonstrative and illustrative purposes only and does not constitute an offering that has gone through regulatory review.

This tutorial can be thought of as 4 distinct parts:

1. A predictive model will be built using SPSS Modeller Flow on Cloud Pack for Data (IBM Watson Studio). The model is deployed to the Watson Machine Learning service V2, where it can be accessed via a REST API.

2. A action developed on IBM Cloud Functions in Node.js to connect to WML service to be scored against the previous model.

3. A ChatBot on Watson Assistant to collect the user / patient information to be socred against the previous model, thru integration on IBM Cloud Functions.

4.  Node.js app to interact to ChatBot to collect data and give the prediction of Heart Failure to the user.

When the reader has completed this tutorial, they will understand how to:

* Build a predictive model within a Modeller Flow on Cloud Pack for Data (Watson Studio)
* Deploy the model to the IBM Watson Machine Learning service
* Create a action on IBM Cloud to call WML service
* Deploy a Chatbot on Watson Studio and integrate it to Cloud Functions
* Via a Node.js app, score some data against the model via an API call to the Watson Machine Learning service

### 1. Setup project and data on Cloud Pack for Data (Watson Studio)

To complete this tutorial we'll need to do a few setup steps before creating our model. In Watson Studio we need to: create a project, add our patient data (which our model will be based on), upload our notebook, and provision a Watson Machine Learning service.

#### 1.1. Create a project on Cloud Pack for Data (Watson Studio)

* Log into IBM's [Cloud Pack for Data (Watson Studio)](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com). Once in, you'll land on the dashboard.

* Create a new project by clicking `+ Crete a project` and choosing `Create an empty project`:

   ![studio project](doc/source/images/Project_Watson_Studio.png)

* Enter a name for the project name and click `Create`.

> **NOTE**: By creating a project in Watson Studio a free tier `Object Storage` service will be created in your IBM Cloud account. Select the `Free` storage type to avoid fees.

#### 1.2 Add patient data as an asset

The data used in this example was generated using a normal distribution. Attributes such as age, gender, heartrate, minutes of exercise per week, and cholesterol are used to create the model we will eventually deploy.

* From the new project `Overview` panel, click `+ Add to project` on the top right and choose the `Data` asset type.

   ![add asset](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/add-assets-data.png)

* A panel on the right of the screen will appear to assit you in uploading data. Follow the numbered steps in the image below.

  * Ensure you're on the `Load` tab. [1]
  * Click on the `browse` option. From your machine, browse to the location of the [`patientdataV6.csv`](data/patientdataV6.csv) file in this repository, and upload it. [not numbered]
  * Once uploaded, go to the `Files` tab. [2]
  * Ensure the `patientdataV6.csv` appears. [3]

   ![add patient data](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/data-add-data-asset.png)

* **TIP:** Once successfully uploaded, the file should appear in the `Data assets` section of the `Assets` tab.

   ![data asset](doc/source/images/asset-list.png)

#### 1.3 Provision a Watson Machine Learning service

* Click on the navigation menu on the left (`☰`) to show additional options. Click on the `Watson Services` option.

   ![add asset](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/hamburger-menu-watson.png)

* From the overview page, click `+ Add service` on the top right and choose the `Machine Learning` service. Select the `Lite` plan to avoid fees.

* Once provisioned, you should see the service listed in the `Watson Services` overview page. **Select the service by opening the link in a new tab.**  We're now in the IBM Cloud tool, where we will create service credentials for our now Watson Machine Learning service. Follow the numbered steps in the image below. **We'll be using these credentials in Step 2, so keep them handy!**.

   ![wml credentials](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/credentials-wml.png)

* **TIP:** You can now go back the project via the navigation menu on the left (`☰`).

   ![add asset](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/hamburger-menu-project.png)

#### 1.4 Create a Modeller Flow in Watson Studio

A completed version can be found in [`model/Heart Failure Prediction.str`](model/Heart Failure Prediction.str).

* From the new project `Overview` panel, click `+ Add to project` on the top right and choose the `Modeller Flow` asset type. Fill in the following information:

  * Select the `New` tab. [1]
  * Enter a `Name` for the flow and optionally a description. [2]
  * Under `Select flow type` choose `Modeller flow`, and under `Run time` choose `IBM SPSS Modeller`
  * Click `Create`

  ![add notebook](doc/source/images/creating-modeller-flow.png)

* **TIP:** Once successfully created, the modeller flow should open the flow editor.

  ![notebook asset](doc/source/images/modeller-flow-editor.png)

### 2. Create and deploy a predictive model with Watson Studio

Now that we're in our Modeller Flow editor, we can start to create our predictive model by stepping through the notebook.

![modeller flow viewer](doc/source/images/modeller-flow-model.png)

#### 2.1 Start stepping through the Modeller Flow

* Open `Import` tab in the left side and drag and drop `Data asset` node to the flow area.
* Double click on `Data asset` node and click on `Change data asset` in the right pane.
* Click on Data Asset, and then `patientdataV6.csv`, and click `Ok`

![data asset](doc/source/images/flow-data-asset.png)

* Open `Fields operations` tab in the left side and drag and drop `Type` node to the flow area.
* Connect `Data asset` node to `Type`.
* Drag and drop `Partition` node to the flow area.
* Double click on `Partition` node and configure `Training partion(%)` to 75, and `Testing partition(%)` to 25, and click `Save`.
* Open `Modeling`tab in the left side and drag and drop `Neural net`node to the flow data.
* Double click on `Neural net` node and check `Use custom fields roles`, then under `Inputs` area click on `Add columns`, uncheck `HEARTFAILURE`, and click `Ok`.
* Under `Targets` area click on `Add columns`, mark the field `HEARTFAILURE`. Click `Ok`and then `Save`
* Run the model - Click on ![run](doc/source/images/run-button.png) button on top os screen.

  ![modeller flow viewer](doc/source/images/modeller-flow-model.png)

#### 2.2 Deploy the model

* Now let's run *Step 6* of the notebook. Deploy our model so we can have an endpoint to score data against.

  ![score-url-in-nb](doc/source/images/score-url-in-nb.png)

Now that we have an API, let's create a client side interface that a typical user would interact with.

<!-- this only works if we associate the service with the project, make this optional

* **TIP:** Once successfully imported, the notebook should appear in the `Models` section of the `Assets` tab. It will likely be named `Heart Failure Prediction Model`.

   ![model asset](doc/source/images/model-asset.png) -->

### 3. The client side

#### 3.1 Deploy the web app

You can deploy this application as a Cloud Foundry application to IBM Cloud by simply clicking the button below. This option will create a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted Git lab project and devops toolchain.

<p align="center">
    <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sergiogama/chatbot-using-predictive-analysis-with-wml-heart-failure">
    <img src="https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy/button_x2.png" alt="Deploy to IBM Cloud">
    </a>
</p>

* You may be prompted for an *IBM Cloud API Key* during this process. Use the `Create (+)` button to auto-fill this field and the others.

   ![pipeline](doc/source/images/pipeline.png)

* Click on the `Deploy` button to deploy the application.

* You can view the URL where the app will live by either waiting for the deployment to finish, or by finding your app from the [IBM Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources).  or Click on the application name, then choose `Visit App URL` from the `Overview` page to open the application in a separate tab.

   ![open app](doc/source/images/open-app.png)

#### 3.2 Bind the app with the existing Maching Learning service

* From the application's overview page, select the `Connections` option from the left menu panel. This will allow us to associate our Watson Machine Learning service with the application. Find the Watson Machine Learning service (likely prefixed with `pm-20`), click the `Connect` button, and choose the default options for the IAM generated credentials. and select the Watson Machine Learning service you provisioned earlier.

  ![connect app](doc/source/images/connect-to.png)

* When prompted to restage your application click the `Restage` button. The app will take a couple of minutes to come back online. Refresh any web pages that have the app running.

> *Why do this?* The application is expecting information about the Maching Learning service via environment variables. By associating the application with the service, details about the service, such as the deployment id, and other sensitive information are accessible through environment variables.

#### 3.3 Interacting with the web app

The app is fairly self-explantory, simply fill in the data you want to score and click on the `Score now` button to test how those figures would score against our model.

* Verify that the model predicts that there is a risk of heart failure for the patient with these medical characteristics.

   ![risk](doc/source/images/failure-yes.png)

* Verify that the model predicts that there is not a risk of heart failure for the patient with these medical characteristics.

   ![no risk](doc/source/images/failure-no.png)
